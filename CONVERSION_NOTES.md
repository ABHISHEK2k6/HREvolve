# HR Evolve Next.js Conversion

This project has been successfully converted from HTML/CSS/JS to Next.js while maintaining the exact same appearance and functionality.

## Conversion Summary

âœ… **Completed Tasks:**
1. **HTML Structure Conversion**: All HTML content from `index.html` has been converted to React JSX in `app/page.tsx`
2. **CSS Migration**: All styling from `styles.css` has been transferred to `app/globals.css` with Next.js compatibility
3. **Image Assets**: All images are properly referenced from the `/public` folder
4. **JavaScript Functionality**: All JavaScript features (slideshow, mobile navigation, modal) have been converted to React hooks
5. **External Dependencies**: Font Awesome, Google Fonts, and GSAP are properly loaded
6. **Responsive Design**: All responsive breakpoints and mobile navigation maintained

## Key Features Preserved

- **Hero Slideshow**: Auto-rotating background images with smooth transitions
- **Mobile Navigation**: Hamburger menu with GSAP animations
- **Modal Dialog**: Registration modal with proper event handling
- **Image Gallery**: Past programs gallery with hover effects
- **Contact Section**: All contact information and links preserved
- **Footer**: Complete footer with social media links
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first responsive layout

## Files Created/Modified

- `app/layout.tsx` - Root layout with metadata and global scripts
- `app/page.tsx` - Main page component with all content
- `app/globals.css` - Complete styling transferred from original
- `app/types.d.ts` - TypeScript declarations for GSAP
- `next.config.js` - Updated for external image domains

## Running the Application

```bash
npm run dev    # Development server
npm run build  # Production build
npm start      # Production server
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and should look and function exactly like the original HTML site.

## Verification

The build process completed successfully with no errors, indicating:
- All TypeScript types are correct
